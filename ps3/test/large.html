Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. I am your worst nightmare! I'll be sure to note that in my log. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? We have a saboteur aboard. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. Ensign Babyface! The unexpected is our normal routine. We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. What? We're not at all alike! You enjoyed that. How long can two people talk about nothing? I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? Damage report! For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Computer, belay that order. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. Shields up! Rrrrred alert! Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy.

Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. I am your worst nightmare! I'll be sure to note that in my log. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? We have a saboteur aboard. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. Ensign Babyface! The unexpected is our normal routine. We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. What? We're not at all alike! You enjoyed that. How long can two people talk about nothing? I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? Damage report! For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. Computer, belay that order. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. Shields up! Rrrrred alert! Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy.
