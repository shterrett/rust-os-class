The provided rust code is old enough that it doesn't remotely compile. Instead,
I am starting over and writing a webserver that meets the following
requirements:

+ returns static html files for GET requests
+ counts (safely) the number of visitors
+ interpolate the result of a shell command into an shtml response
+ handles multiple concurrent requests
+ preferentially scheduling requests from a particular IP range
+ schedules responses to prioritize fastest expected response times
+ stream file responses
+ cache files in memory
